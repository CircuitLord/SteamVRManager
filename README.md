SVR Manager is a tool that can fix and tweak SteamVR to your liking.

### So what exactly can it do?
- Rescan for hardware on SteamVR launch: fixes headset audio device not showing.
- Use Dashboard Quality Fix: uses the fix found by [SweViver](https://forum.pimaxvr.com/t/how-to-get-full-clarity-sharpness-in-steamvr-dashboard-overlay-on-low-end-gpus-with-pimax/) to obtain full quality on the SteamVR dashboard regardless of GPU.
- Set specific audio levels for when SteamVR is opened or closed.
- Launch any custom exes or scripts you want when SteamVR is opened.
- It auto-updates! Fancy, right?
- (Coming soon!) Launching SteamVR in a specific refresh rate mode without having to retart it.

### Sounds cool! How do I get it?
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/CircuitLord/SteamVRManager/releases) page, and pick up the SteamVRManagerInstall.exe.
Simply run that, install the program, and you should be good to go!

Check any of the boxes and configure the settings to your liking, then simply leave it minimized. It'll do what it needs to whenever it detects SteamVR opening or closing.
